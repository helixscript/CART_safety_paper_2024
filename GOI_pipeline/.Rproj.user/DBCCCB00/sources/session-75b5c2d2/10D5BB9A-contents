Analysis provided in the "Linking outcome of CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy with genome modification by vector integration" manuscript.

This repository is meant to provide the source code for the analysis provided in the above manuscript by Christopher L. Nobles, Scott Sherrill-Mix, John Everett, Shantan Reddy, Joseph A. Fraietta, David Porter, Noelle Frey, Saar Gill, Steven Grupp, Shannon Maude, Donald Siegel, Bruce Levine, Carl H. June, Simon F. Lacey, J. Joseph Melenhorst, and Frederic D. Bushman.

Abstract:
    Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T-cells targeting CD19 (CART19) provide an effective treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but are less effective for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), focusing attention on improving efficacy. CART19 cells harbor an engineered receptor, which is delivered through lentiviral vector integration, thereby marking cell lineages and modifying the cellular genome by insertional mutagenesis. We recently reported that vector integration within the host TET2 gene was associated with CLL remission â€“ here we investigated clonal population structure and therapeutic outcomes in another 39 subjects by high-throughput sequencing of vector integration sites. Genes at integration sites enriched in responders were commonly found in cell signaling and chromatin modification pathways, suggesting that insertional mutagenesis in these genes promoted therapeutic T-cell proliferation. We also developed a multivariate model based on integration site distributions and found that data from pre-infusion products forecasted response in CLL successfully in discovery and validation cohorts, and in day 28 samples reported responders to CLL therapy with high accuracy. These data thus clarify how insertional mutagenesis can modulate cell proliferation in CART19 therapy, and how data on integration site distributions can be linked to treatment outcomes.

To run the analysis, run `Rscript initiate_analysis.R`, which will subsequenty process the input data, populate the directory with informational files, and generate a report with the manuscript figures. Additionally, the user can specify a number of cores to use for parallelization with a `-c` option. i.e. `Rscript initiate_analysis.R -c 20`

This repository also contains a final INSPIIRED input dataset from the manuscript. Anyone can use this data rather than reprocessing with the INSPIIRED software from the SRA submission (BioProject: PRJNA510570). These data were processed with the [intSiteCaller v1.2.0 software](https://github.com/BushmanLab/intSiteCaller), within the [INSPIIRED suite](https://github.com/BushmanLab/INSPIIRED).
